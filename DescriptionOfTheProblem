Task
Create a backend for a food warehouse that exposes RESTful APIs that perform CRUD
(Create, Retrieve, Update, Delete) operations. The backend must be programmed using Jersey
as the REST framework and must be compatible with Java11.
Expectations
The Data storage method is completely up to you to decide. This can be as simple as an
in-memory data structure, writing to a file, or deciding to use a NoSQL or SQL database. You’re
free to choose.
We expect to see some sort of testing and this can be as minimal as you would like. A written
description of a testing strategy is also acceptable if there isn’t enough time to write the tests
that you wanted.
We would like a Readme document with setup instructions and notes on how to run and use the
backend. This document can also contain explanations for the decisions you made.
Documentation of the APIs that you implemented. It’s completely your choice how to showcase
to us a professional, simple, and readable documentation of your APIs. It must allow another
Engineer to use your backend.
