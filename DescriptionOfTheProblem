Task
Create a backend for a food warehouse that exposes RESTful APIs that perform CRUD
(Create, Retrieve, Update, Delete) operations. The backend must be programmed using Jersey
as the REST framework and must be compatible with Java11.
Expectations
The Data storage method is completely up to you to decide. This can be as simple as an
in-memory data structure, writing to a file, or deciding to use a NoSQL or SQL database. You’re
free to choose.
We expect to see some sort of testing and this can be as minimal as you would like. A written
description of a testing strategy is also acceptable if there isn’t enough time to write the tests
that you wanted.
We would like a Readme document with setup instructions and notes on how to run and use the
backend. This document can also contain explanations for the decisions you made.
Documentation of the APIs that you implemented. It’s completely your choice how to showcase
to us a professional, simple, and readable documentation of your APIs. It must allow another
Engineer to use your backend.


Result:

Data Model
Feel free to create and design your own data model that will help you create the APIs. Make
sure that all items have at least a name and weight attribute. You may make the data model as
simple or complex as you wish.

For a backend to function at its most basic level it should have APIs exposed to add, get and
delete food items. Below are some examples:
● Some examples for fetching food items:
○ Get something specific by ID
○ Get all items
○ Get all vegetables

You may wish to add APIs that show more of your skill or to showcase something special. This
is optional and not a requirement of the task. Below are some examples:
● Special API that calculates the weight of all products in a group. Examples:
○ Get the weight of all food items
○ Get the weight of all vegetables
